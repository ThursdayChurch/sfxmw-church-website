		Below, are buttons to change the overall "style" of the website.  The current options are defined as:
		<br />
		A --> Original style - left navigation; simple box layout
		<br />
		B --> Similar to A, but corners are rounded and there is space between the navigation area and the 
		main page area.
		<br />
		C --> Navigation is moved to the top and the primary content becomes a fixed width. 
		<br /><br />
		Current style:&nbsp;
		<% if session[:style] == 'a' %>
			A
		<% elsif session[:style] == 'b' %> 
			B 
		<% else %> 
			C 
		<% end %>

		<%= button_to 'Style A', :action => 'style_a', :method => :get %>
		<%= button_to 'Style B', :action => 'style_b', :method => :get %>
