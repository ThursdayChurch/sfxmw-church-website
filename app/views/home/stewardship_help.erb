<br/>
<h3>How does Online Stewardship work?</h3>
<div id="shift_right">
  <p>
    The Online Stewardship process is designed to allow for you to easily choose all the ministries with which you want to be involved, and to allow for you to designate how you would like to tithe to the church.

    The Web pages guide you through:
    <ol>
    <li> updating all of your Family census information </li>
    <li> selecting which ministries you or a family member may want to participate </li>
    <li> selecting how you would like to tithe to the church, through envelopes, bank withdrawal, or credit card </li>
    </ol>
    and once you submit your information, an email confirmation detailing your selections for Stewardship will be sent to you.

<h3>Does Online Stewardship allow for credit card tithing?</h3>
<div id="shift_right">
  <p>
    Yes, you can now setup a recurring (monthly only) payment to the Church via PayPal using the Online Stewardship Form.  When you
    select to pay by credit card, then you will get a chance to pick the monthly payment amount.  After you select the monthly payment 
    amount and click the blue button, you will then get redirected to paypal.com to complete the transaction, either by using your 
    existing PayPal account, or by creating a new PayPal account with the credit card you want to use for the payment.  This recurring 
    payment will only last for 12 months, after which, you can renew during next year's Stewardship program.

<h3>Why is Saint Francis Xavier using PayPal?</h3>
<div id="shift_right">
  <p>
    The Church is using PayPal as its Online Merchant for Credit Card processing, since PayPal offers the security necessary for handling such sensitive data online.  When you make your monthly recurring payment to the church via PayPal, you will have full control over your account, the church will not have your credit card data - PayPal will.

<h3>Can I cancel my credit card tithing at anytime?</h3>
<div id="shift_right">
  <p>
    Yes.  If you used PayPal, then you can log into your PayPal account, under your Profile setting to cancel the payment to the Church.  Or, you can contact the Church Office, and have them cancel your Credit Card payment.

<h3>I am seeing jotform.com in the URL after I submit my Stewardship Intention, what is JotForm?</h3>
<div id="shift_right">
  <p>
   JotForm.com is the third-party company the Church is using to handle all the Stewardship submissions online.  The JotForm company's database will hold the data from these online Stewardship submissions for a period of time until the data gets imported into the Church's Parish Data System.  All online data transmissions to JotForm will be secure using HTTPS. 
  </p>
</div>

<br/>
<h3>Is my data secure?</h3>
<div id="shift_right">
  <p>
    All online information is securely posted to JotForm.com, and if you chose credit card tithing, then secure post to PayPal for you to enter your payment data.  Once you select the blue button to submit your Online Stewardship Intentions, you web browser will create an HTTPS connection and then transmit data.
